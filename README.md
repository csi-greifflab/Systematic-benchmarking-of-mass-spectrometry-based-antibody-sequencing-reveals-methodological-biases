# Description

This repository contains data, preprocessing pipeline, figure scripts, and supplementary materials for the manuscript **Systematic benchmarking of mass spectrometry-based antibody sequencing reveals methodological biases**.

## 📄 Data

All raw mass spectrometry data are publicly available via **ProteomeXchange** under the identifier **PXD055846**.

This repository includes both the raw outputs from proteomics tools and the preprocessed peptide data:

- `data/raw/`  
  Contains the raw output files generated by the following tools:  
  - Casanovo (Yilmaz et al., 2024)  
  - MaxQuant (Cox & Mann, 2008)  
  - MSFragger (Kong et al., 2017)

- `data/processed/`  
  Contains preprocessed peptide dataframes:
  - `peptides_preprocessed_TP.tsv` – Peptides that map to the monoclonal antibody (mAb) sequence present in the sample (True Positives) after filtration of potential contaminations (used for Figures 3-6).
  - `peptides_preprocessed_TP_FP.tsv` – All mAb-related peptides (both True Positives and False Positives) after filtration of potential contaminations (used for Figure 2).
  - `peptides_all_TP_FP_with_blanks.tsv` – All mAb-related peptides before filtration of potential contaminations, including those from blank samples.

See [`src/data_preprocessing/run_data_preprocessing.R`](src/data_preprocessing/run_data_preprocessing.R) for the full data preprocessing pipeline.


## 📄 Metadata
The `metadata/` directory contains supporting reference files used throughout the analysis, including:

- Monoclonal antibody (mAb) sequences
- Reference protein database
- Sample descriptions 

## 📊 Figures
Scripts used to generate each main figure are located in the corresponding subfolders (`fig2/`, `fig3/`, etc.).


## 📎 Supplementary files
`supplementary_files` folder contains the following Supplementary files:

- Supplementary File 1: MaxQuant parameter file example for the tryptic samples from experimental replicate 1
- Supplementary File 2: MSFragger parameter file example for the tryptic samples from experimental replicate 1 
- Supplementary File 3: Casanovo config file
- Supplementary File 4: Stitch example config file for h9C12 WT
